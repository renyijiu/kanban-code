Feature: Headless runtime engine (no macOS app)
  As an operator running agents headless on a server
  I want the always-on engine (hooks, auto-send, auto-compaction) to run as a daemon
  So that agents keep working forever without the macOS Kanban Code app open

  Background:
    Given the headless kanban daemon is running on the box
    And Claude Code hooks and the statusline script are installed for the agents

  Scenario: Hooks are installed headlessly
    When the daemon installs hooks
    Then ~/.claude/settings.json registers Stop, Notification, SessionStart, SessionEnd and UserPromptSubmit hooks pointing at ~/.kanban-code/hook.sh
    And a statusline command writes context usage to ~/.kanban-code/context/<sessionId>.json
    And hook events are appended to ~/.kanban-code/hook-events.jsonl
    And re-installing is idempotent (no duplicate hook entries)

  Scenario: Queued prompts auto-send when the agent goes idle
    Given a prompt is queued for an agent with sendAutomatically true
    When the agent emits a Stop hook event and no user prompt arrives shortly after
    Then the queued prompt is sent to the agent's tmux session
    And it is removed from the queue

  Scenario: A recent user prompt pauses auto-send
    Given a prompt is queued for an agent
    When a UserPromptSubmit event is recorded shortly after the Stop
    Then the queued prompt is not auto-sent (a human or relay is already driving)

  Scenario: Auto-compaction protects long-running sessions
    Given an agent has been running for a long time
    When its current context usage crosses 500k tokens
    Then a prompt instructing it to self-compact is sent to it straight away (not parked in the queue waiting for a Stop)
    And so a resumed or idle session, which never emits a Stop, still gets the nudge and self-compacts before context grows further
    And the same threshold is not nudged twice
    When usage crosses the hard threshold (750k)
    Then "/compact" is sent to the agent automatically

  Scenario: The session runs forever across compactions
    Given the agent has compacted multiple times
    Then the same Claude session id is retained
    And the agent continues without a human restart

  Scenario: Reboot and resume survival
    Given the box reboots, wakes from hibernate, or a spot instance is reclaimed and restored
    When the box finishes booting
    Then reconcile-on-boot resumes every configured agent with "--resume <uuid>"
    And the daemon is restarted by the service manager

  Scenario: An agent can be driven by the Codex runtime instead of Claude
    Given an agent declares "runtime: codex" in the agents config
    When the reconciler launches it
    Then it runs "codex --no-alt-screen --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust" in tmux (no Claude --session-id/--resume)
    And the daemon's context-threshold self-compaction is skipped for it (Codex auto-compacts and exposes no context usage)
    And sending and Slack-inbound steering work unchanged because they paste into the tmux session by slug
    And its movement is mirrored to Slack by tailing its Codex rollout transcript (located by the agent's workspace cwd), since Codex 0.134.0 gates command hooks behind a trust prompt that --dangerously-bypass-hook-trust does not suppress in the inline TUI
